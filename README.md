Imagine you're in a *1960's TV game show* called ***'Let's Make a Deal'***, The show present a game of chances,
The host, A certain Mr Monty Hall asks you to choose one of the three large doors,
One of those doors hides the car, And behind the other two there are goats, After you have made your choice, The host opens another door revealing a goat, He then tells you whether you want to stay with your initial choice, Or switch to the remaining closed door.

So would you switch or stay ?!

The host always will make the move, He naturaly knows which door hides the prize 'The Car', So when you have made your choice whether
if you choose the correct door or not, He will reveal a door that hides a goat, And always asks you to switch or keep your initial choice.

**The origins of the MHP**

Also known as The Monty Hall Paradox, The problem was introduced by the bio-statistician **Steve Selvin** (1975a), In a letter to the journal ***The American Statistician***.

The problem, True to reality or not, Became world famous in 1990 with its presentation in the popular weekly column "Ask Marilyn" in Parade magazine. The author Marilyn Vos Savant, Was, According to the Guiness Book of Records at the time, The person with the highest IQ in the world. Rewriting in her own words a problem
posed to her by a correspondent, Craig Whitaker, vos Savant asked the following:

> "Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?".
